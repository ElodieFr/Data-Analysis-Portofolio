## Project 1 : Conduct a Public Health Study / Python & SQL

**📋 Scenario**

You join a new team of researchers at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), whose mission is to “help build a world free of hunger.” Your team is tasked with conducting a large-scale study on global undernutrition.
The complexity of hunger requires understanding various root causes, which vary across countries. As a preliminary step, your team must conduct a literature review and a statistical study to identify high-priority countries and potential causes of hunger.
You have been chosen to set up the SQL database that your team will use to run queries for this statistical analysis.

**🎓 Skills Acquired**

- Understand the importance of domain knowledge in data analysis
- Master the basics of Python
- Apply relational algebra in Python
- Use Data Science libraries (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn)
- Perform complex SQL queries
- Use technical documentation

## Project 2: Analyze Your Company's Performance / Python

**📋 Scenario**

You are a newly hired Data Analyst at a large bookstore chain. The IT department has just granted you access to the sales database. Your manager asks you to explore and analyze this data as a first task.
The company, Rester livres, initially grew through multiple physical stores before launching a successful online store based on book recommendation algorithms.

**🎓 Skills Acquired**

- Clean a dataset
- Use descriptive statistics to summarize data
- Master fundamental statistical concepts

**🛠️ Tools & Concepts**

Descriptive statistics, Python

## Project 3: Produce a Market Study / Python

**📋 Scenario**

You work for a poultry-based food company that aims to expand internationally. However, the field is wide open: no country or continent has been selected yet. Your goal is to help narrow down target countries by identifying clusters with shared characteristics.
The short-term strategy is to export products rather than produce them locally in the new markets.

**🎓 Skills Acquired**

- Master inferential statistics
- Build and interpret a dendrogram
- Conduct and interpret PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

**🛠️ Tools & Concepts**

Descriptive statistics, clustering, PCA, Python

## Project 4: Detect Counterfeit Banknotes

**📋 Scenario**

Your IT consulting company assigns you to a project at the Ministry of the Interior, specifically with the Central Office for Counterfeit Currency Suppression. Your mission: develop an algorithm to detect counterfeit banknotes.

**🎓 Skills Acquired**

- Apply K-means clustering
- Conduct and interpret PCA
- Build a logistic regression model
- Provide a brief data summary

**🛠️ Tools & Concepts**

Descriptive statistics, PCA, automatic classification, logistic regression, Python

---
## Project 5: Predict Income Levels / Python

**📋 Scenario**

You work at a bank with international operations. The marketing team wants to identify young potential customers likely to become high-income earners in the future. Your team is tasked with building a model to predict an individual's future income.

**🎓 Skills Acquired**

-Understand the basics of inferential statistics and probabilities
- Build and evaluate data models

**🛠️ Tools & Concepts**
Descriptive statistics, PCA, classification, Python

---
## Project 6: Predict Electricity Demand / Python

**📋 Scenario**

You work at Enercoop, a cooperative that grew through the liberalization of the French electricity market and focuses on renewable energy.
However, these sources are intermittent, making electricity production hard to forecast. At the same time, demand fluctuates based on factors like weather. The challenge is to match supply with demand.

**🎓 Skills Acquired**

- Master smoothing methods and Holt-Winters
- Understand time series components and decomposition models
- Use ARMA models
- Visualize time series data

**🛠️ Tools & Concepts**

Python, time series forecasting
